Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to configuring a VPN Gateway in Azure:

1. **Sign in to the Azure Portal**: Go to https://portal.azure.com and sign in with your Azure account.

2. **Navigate to VPN Gateway**: Once logged in, navigate to the VPN Gateway service by either searching for "VPN Gateway" in the search bar or by finding it in the Azure services menu.

3. **Create a VPN Gateway**: Click on the "Create VPN Gateway" button to begin the configuration process.

4. **Basics**: In the Basics tab, provide the necessary information such as Subscription, Resource group, Region, and Gateway type. Select the appropriate Gateway type (VPN Gateway). Click "Next: Configuration".

5. **Configuration**: In this section, you'll configure the VPN Gateway with the necessary parameters:
   - **VPN Type**: Choose between Policy-based or Route-based VPN. Policy-based VPNs are generally simpler but have limitations in terms of scalability and flexibility. Route-based VPNs offer more flexibility and are recommended for most scenarios.
   - **SKU**: Choose the SKU (Service Level) for your VPN Gateway. Options typically include Basic or various performance tiers like VpnGw1, VpnGw2, etc. The selection depends on your performance and throughput requirements.
   - **VPN Client Address Pool**: Specify the range of IP addresses that VPN clients will use when they connect to the VPN Gateway.
   - **Gateway Subnet**: Specify the subnet for the VPN Gateway. This subnet must be large enough to accommodate the maximum number of VPN connections you expect.
   - **Public IP Address**: You can either create a new public IP address or use an existing one for the VPN Gateway.
   - **Routing Type**: Choose between BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) or Static Routing. BGP is typically used for complex network setups where dynamic routing is required.
   - **Gateway Configuration**: Choose whether to enable or disable Active-Active mode. This option is only available for certain SKUs.
   - **High Availability**: Choose whether to enable active-active or active-passive mode for high availability.
   - **SKU**: Choose the SKU (Service Level) for your VPN Gateway. Options typically include Basic or various performance tiers like VpnGw1, VpnGw2, etc. The selection depends on your performance and throughput requirements.
   - **VPN Client Address Pool**: Specify the range of IP addresses that VPN clients will use when they connect to the VPN Gateway.
   - **Gateway Subnet**: Specify the subnet for the VPN Gateway. This subnet must be large enough to accommodate the maximum number of VPN connections you expect.
   - **Public IP Address**: You can either create a new public IP address or use an existing one for the VPN Gateway.
   - **Routing Type**: Choose between BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) or Static Routing. BGP is typically used for complex network setups where dynamic routing is required.
   - **Gateway Configuration**: Choose whether to enable or disable Active-Active mode. This option is only available for certain SKUs.
   - **High Availability**: Choose whether to enable active-active or active-passive mode for high availability.

6. **Review + Create**: Review the settings you've configured, make sure everything is correct, then click "Create" to deploy the VPN Gateway.

7. **Deployment**: The deployment process may take several minutes to complete. Once it's finished, you'll see a notification in the Azure portal indicating that the deployment was successful.

8. **Connection Settings**: After the VPN Gateway is deployed, you can configure the connection settings to connect your on-premises network to Azure. This typically involves configuring VPN tunnels, local network gateways, and VPN connections.

That's it! You've successfully configured a VPN Gateway in Azure. You can now use it to securely connect your on-premises network to Azure resources.
