To configure a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN connection between your on-premises network and Azure, you'll need several components and steps:

1. **Azure Setup**:
   - **Virtual Network**: Create a virtual network (VNet) in the Azure portal.
   - **Subnets**: Define one or more subnets within the virtual network.
   - **VPN Gateway**: Configure and deploy a VPN gateway in the virtual network.
   - **Gateway Subnet**: Create a gateway subnet within your virtual network.
   - **Public IP Address**: Allocate a public IP address for the VPN gateway.
   - **Local Network Gateway**: Define a local network gateway in Azure to represent your on-premises network.

2. **On-Premises Setup**:
   - **VPN Device**: Have a compatible VPN device or software running on your on-premises network.
   - **Public IP Address**: Ensure your on-premises network has a public IP address or is accessible via a public IP address for the VPN connection.

3. **Configure VPN Gateway in Azure**:
   - When configuring a VPN gateway in Azure, you'll need to choose between two VPN types: Policy-based or Route-based (also known as static-routing or dynamic-routing). The choice between the two depends on your specific network requirements and configurations:

4. **Configure Local Network Gateway in Azure**:
   - Define a local network gateway in Azure to represent your on-premises network. This includes specifying the public IP address or address range of your on-premises VPN device.

5. **VPN Device Configuration**:
   - Configure your on-premises VPN device to establish a connection with the Azure VPN gateway. This involves setting up the VPN tunnel, encryption settings, and authentication parameters.

6. **Connectivity Testing**:
   - Once the configurations are complete, initiate the VPN connection from your on-premises VPN device to the Azure VPN gateway.
   - Verify connectivity by checking for successful tunnel establishment and testing communication between resources in Azure and your on-premises network.

7. **Network Routing**:
   - Ensure that appropriate network routing is configured on both the on-premises network and Azure to direct traffic between the two networks through the VPN tunnel.

By following these steps and configuring the necessary components both in Azure and on-premises, you can establish a Site-to-Site VPN connection between your on-premises network and Azure.
