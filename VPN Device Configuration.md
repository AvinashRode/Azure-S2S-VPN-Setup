## VPN Device Configuration

Using OpenVPN for your on-premises VPN connection to Azure is a feasible option. Here's how you can proceed with setting up OpenVPN for this purpose:

1. **Set Up OpenVPN Server**:
   - Choose a server within your on-premises network where you'll install and configure the OpenVPN server software.
   - Install OpenVPN on the chosen server following the installation instructions provided by OpenVPN community or your distribution's package manager.

2. **Configure OpenVPN Server**:
   - Generate server and client certificates and keys. You can use the EasyRSA tool bundled with OpenVPN for this purpose.
   - Configure OpenVPN server settings, including the VPN subnet, encryption parameters, authentication method, and other options as per your requirements.
   - Set up appropriate firewall rules to allow traffic to and from the OpenVPN server.

3. **OpenVPN Client Configuration**:
   - Install the OpenVPN client software on the on-premises server that needs to connect to Azure. Follow the instructions provided by OpenVPN community or the client package manager.
   - Configure the OpenVPN client by providing the server's IP address or domain name, port, protocol, and other connection details.
   - Import the client certificate and key, and configure authentication settings if required.

4. **Azure VPN Gateway Configuration**:
   - Set up a VPN gateway in Azure and configure it with the appropriate settings, including the VPN type (route-based), encryption algorithms, and authentication settings.
   - Generate and download the VPN configuration file from the Azure portal, which contains the necessary settings for the OpenVPN client.

5. **Test Connectivity**:
   - Start the OpenVPN client on the on-premises server and initiate the VPN connection to the Azure VPN gateway using the downloaded configuration file.
   - Verify that the VPN connection is successfully established.
   - Test connectivity by attempting to access resources in Azure from the on-premises server.

6. **Monitor and Maintain**:
   - Monitor the VPN connection for stability and performance.
   - Regularly update and maintain the OpenVPN server and client software to ensure security and compatibility.
